# ChatTCP

ChatTCP is a simple chat application that enables communication between two users using TCP/IP.

It allows real-time messaging, and in the event of a lost connection, users will be notified.

## Features

- **Real-time Communication**: Send and receive messages instantly.
- **Server and Client Mode**: Choose to either start a server or connect to an existing one.
